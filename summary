If your development system is booted from EFI it may be that you don't have the PC-BIOS version of the grub binaries installed anywhere. If you install them then grub-mkrescue will by default produce a hybrid ISO that will work in QEMU. On Ubuntu this can be achieved with: apt-get install grub-pc-bin.
